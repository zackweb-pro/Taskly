## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Authentication Architecture**
```
User Login → Supabase Auth → JWT Token → Chrome Storage → API Calls
```

### **Data Flow**
```
Tasks Created → Check Auth Status → Use User ID or Guest ID → Save to Supabase
```

### **Session Management**
```
Login → Store JWT → Auto-refresh → API calls use user token → RLS filters data
```
